**You need:**
- A plan
- Progressive overload
- Consistency

These 3 templates are designed for home training. Pick the one that matches your equipment. Follow it for 8-12 weeks. Add weight or reps when you can.

## Progression Guidelines

**Rule #1: Add reps first, then weight**

Example (Goblet Squat):
- Week 1: 30 lbs x 8 reps
- Week 2: 30 lbs x 10 reps
- Week 3: 30 lbs x 12 reps (hit top of range)
- Week 4: 35 lbs x 8 reps (increase weight, drop reps)

**Rule #2: Track everything**

Write down every set, every rep, every weight. You can't improve what you don't measure.

**Rule #3: Rest longer if needed**

Don't rush sets. If you need 3 minutes to recover, take 3 minutes. Quality > speed.

## FAQs

### Can I build muscle with bodyweight training?

Yes, especially if you're a beginner. Once you can do 20+ push-ups and 10+ pull-ups, you'll need to add weight or do harder variations.

### How do I add weight to bodyweight exercises?

- Wear a weighted vest or backpack
- Add tempo (3-second descent, 2-second pause)
- Increase difficulty (elevate feet, single-arm push-ups, archer pull-ups)

### What if I don't have a pull-up bar?

- Use resistance bands for rows
- Do inverted rows under a sturdy table
- Fill a backpack with books and do bent-over rows

### Can I do this 5-6 days per week?

You can, but you don't need to. More isn't always better. Stick with 3-4 days for the first 8-12 weeks.

### Do I need to do cardio?

Not for strength or muscle gain. But 2-3 sessions per week (20-30 min, easy pace) helps with recovery and conditioning.

### How long until I see results?

- **Strength:** 4-6 weeks (you'll feel stronger)
- **Muscle:** 6-8 weeks (visible changes)
- **Fat loss:** 4-6 weeks (if you're eating in a deficit)

## Final Thoughts

Home training works.

**You don't need a fancy gym. You need a plan and the discipline to follow it.**

Pick the template that matches your equipment. Train 3-4 days per week. Add weight or reps when you can. Eat enough protein. Sleep well.

Do that for 12 weeks and you'll build more strength than most people who spin their wheels in a fully-equipped gym.
