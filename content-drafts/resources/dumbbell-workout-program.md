# Dumbbell Workout Program (4-Day Split)

**By Ian Ramirez, Cypress Training Center**  
**For:** Intermediate lifters with adjustable dumbbells and a bench  
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes per session  
**Frequency:** 4 days per week  
**Equipment Needed:** Adjustable dumbbells (10-50+ lbs), flat or adjustable bench

---

## Who Is This For?

This program is perfect if you:
- Have adjustable dumbbells and a bench at home
- Want a structured 4-day split for muscle building
- Have 6+ months of training experience
- Can train 4 days per week consistently

This is an upper/lower split with push/pull separation. More volume than a 3-day full-body program, but still manageable for home training.

## The Program

**Schedule:** 4 days per week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday)

---

### Day 1: Upper Push

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| Dumbbell Bench Press | 4 x 6-10 | 3 min | Main lift |
| Dumbbell Overhead Press | 3 x 8-12 | 2 min | Shoulders |
| Incline Dumbbell Press | 3 x 10-12 | 90 sec | Upper chest |
| Dumbbell Skullcrushers | 3 x 12-15 | 90 sec | Triceps |

**Notes:**
- Bench press is your main lift — heaviest weight, longest rest
- Overhead press second — still heavy, but lighter than bench
- Incline press for volume — higher reps, shorter rest
- Skullcrushers to finish triceps

**Scaling:**
- Too heavy? Drop to 3 sets, rest longer
- Too easy? Add pause at bottom, slow tempo (3-second descent)

### Day 2: Lower Body

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| Goblet Squat | 4 x 8-12 | 3 min | Hold dumbbell at chest |
| Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift | 3 x 10-12 | 2 min | Hamstrings |
| Bulgarian Split Squat | 3 x 10-12 per leg | 90 sec | Single-leg work |
| Calf Raises | 3 x 15-20 | 60 sec | Standing, dumbbells in hands |

**Notes:**
- Goblet squat is your main quad exercise
- RDL hits hamstrings and glutes
- Bulgarian split squats for single-leg strength and balance
- Calf raises to finish

---

### Day 3: Upper Pull

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| Dumbbell Row | 4 x 8-12 per arm | 2 min | Main lift |
| Dumbbell Pullover | 3 x 10-12 | 90 sec | Lats |
| Dumbbell Shrugs | 3 x 12-15 | 90 sec | Traps |
| Dumbbell Bicep Curl | 3 x 12-15 | 60 sec | Arms |

**Notes:**
- Rows are your main back builder
- Pullovers hit lats from a different angle
- Shrugs for traps (don't skip these)
- Curls because you earned them

---

### Day 4: Full Body / Conditioning

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| Dumbbell Thrusters | 3 x 10-12 | 90 sec | Squat to overhead press |
| Dumbbell Swing | 3 x 15-20 | 90 sec | Explosive hip hinge |
| Renegade Rows | 3 x 8-10 per arm | 90 sec | Push-up position, row each side |
| Farmer's Carry | 3 x 40-60 sec | 90 sec | Walk with heavy dumbbells |

**Notes:**
- This day is lighter and more conditioning-focused
- Thrusters = full-body power
- Swings = explosive hips
- Renegade rows = core + back
- Farmer's carries = grip + core

---

## Progression Rules

**Add 2.5-5 lbs per week** when you hit the top of the rep range.

**Example (Dumbbell Bench Press):**
- Week 1: 40 lb dumbbells × 8 reps
- Week 2: 40 lbs × 10 reps
- Week 3: 40 lbs × 12 reps (hit top of range)
- Week 4: 45 lbs × 8 reps (increase weight, drop reps)

**When to deload:**
- Every 6-8 weeks, take a lighter week
- Use 50-60% of your working weights
- Keep reps the same, just lighter load

## Exercise Notes

### Dumbbell Bench Press
**How to do it:**
1. Lie on bench, dumbbells at chest level
2. Press up until arms are straight
3. Lower controlled to chest level

**Common mistakes:**
- Flaring elbows out 90 degrees (tuck to 45 degrees)
- Bouncing dumbbells off chest (control the descent)
- Not touching chest (full range of motion)

### Goblet Squat
**How to do it:**
1. Hold one dumbbell vertically at chest (like a goblet)
2. Squat down, elbows inside knees
3. Drive through mid-foot to stand

**Why goblet instead of dumbbell squat?** Easier to load, better for form, feels more natural.

### Dumbbell Row
**How to do it:**
1. One knee and hand on bench
2. Dumbbell in free hand
3. Pull dumbbell to hip, elbow stays close to body
4. Lower with control

**Common mistakes:**
- Curling the dumbbell (row it, don't curl it)
- Twisting your torso (keep back flat)
- Not pulling to hip (full range of motion)

### Dumbbell RDL
**How to do it:**
1. Hold dumbbells in front of thighs
2. Slight knee bend, push hips back
3. Lower dumbbells down shins (feel hamstring stretch)
4. Drive hips forward to stand

**Why:** Builds hamstrings and glutes without taxing your lower back like conventional deadlifts.

## FAQs

### What weight dumbbells should I buy?

**Minimum:** Adjustable set that goes to 50 lbs per dumbbell  
**Better:** Adjustable set that goes to 75+ lbs per dumbbell

You'll outgrow 50s within 6-12 months on lower body exercises. If you can afford it, get a set that goes higher.

### Can I do this 3 days per week instead of 4?

Yes. Combine Day 1 + Day 3 (upper body push + pull) and do 3 full-body days per week. But 4 days is better for muscle growth.

### What about abs?

Add 2-3 sets of planks or ab wheel rollouts at the end of any day. But if you're bracing hard on squats and rows, your core is already getting worked.

### How long until I see results?

- **Strength:** 4-6 weeks
- **Muscle:** 6-8 weeks (if you're eating enough)
- **Fat loss:** 4-6 weeks (if you're eating in a deficit)

### What if I don't have a bench?

- Bench press → Floor press (lie on floor, dumbbells in hands, press up)
- Incline press → Standing overhead press
- Bulgarian split squats → Use a couch or sturdy chair

## Final Thoughts

Dumbbells and a bench are all you need to build serious strength and muscle.

This program gives you enough volume to grow, enough frequency to progress, and enough variety to stay engaged.

Train 4 days per week. Add weight when you can. Eat enough protein. Sleep well.

Do that for 12 weeks and you'll be stronger and more muscular than 90% of people with full gym memberships.
