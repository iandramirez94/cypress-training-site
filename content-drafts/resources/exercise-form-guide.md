## Introduction

This guide covers proper form for the foundational strength movements you'll use in 80% of your training.

**Why these movements?**
- They train multiple muscle groups at once (time-efficient)
- They allow progressive overload (you can add weight systematically)
- They build functional, transferable strength

**How to use this guide:**
- Read the setup, execution, and cues for each lift
- Film yourself from the side and front
- Compare your form to the descriptions
- Pick ONE cue per session to focus on

Let's get to work.

## The Big 5 Compound Movements

---

<a name="squat"></a>
### 1. Back Squat

**Muscles Worked:** Quads, glutes, hamstrings, core, upper back

**Setup:**
1. Bar on upper traps (high bar) or rear delts (low bar) — pick one and stay consistent
2. Grip slightly wider than shoulders, squeeze the bar into your back
3. Feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out (10-15 degrees)
4. Take a big breath into your belly, brace your core

**Execution:**
1. Break at hips and knees simultaneously
2. Descend controlled (2-3 seconds), keep chest up, knees track over toes
3. Hit depth: hip crease below top of knee
4. Drive through mid-foot, squeeze glutes at the top
5. Exhale, reset, repeat

**Key Cues:**
- "Spread the floor" with your feet (keeps knees out)
- "Big chest" (prevents forward lean)
- "Drive through heels" (but keep full foot planted)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Knees caving in → Strengthen glutes, use a band around knees
- ❌ Forward lean / "good morning" squat → Lighter weight, focus on chest up
- ❌ Bouncing out of the hole → Pause at the bottom, control the ascent

**Progressions:**
- Beginner: Goblet squat (dumbbell or kettlebell)
- Intermediate: Back squat (high or low bar)
- Advanced: Pause squats, tempo squats, front squats

<a name="deadlift"></a>
### 2. Deadlift

**Muscles Worked:** Glutes, hamstrings, lower back, upper back, grip

**Setup:**
1. Bar over mid-foot (closer than you think — should be touching your shins)
2. Feet hip-width apart, toes slightly out
3. Grip just outside your legs (double overhand or mixed grip)
4. Hinge at hips, bend knees until shins touch bar
5. Chest up, shoulders slightly in front of bar, lats engaged ("pull the bar into your body")
6. Deep breath, brace core

**Execution:**
1. Push the floor away with your legs (think "leg press")
2. Bar stays glued to your shins/thighs the entire way up
3. Hips and shoulders rise at the same rate (don't let hips shoot up first)
4. Lock out at the top: hips forward, shoulders back, squeeze glutes
5. Lower controlled (reverse the movement), don't drop the bar

**Key Cues:**
- "Drag the bar up your legs"
- "Chest up, lats tight"
- "Push the floor, don't pull the bar"

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Hips shooting up first (turns into a stiff-leg deadlift) → Reset, focus on leg drive
- ❌ Rounding lower back → Lighter weight, brace harder, improve hip mobility
- ❌ Bar drifting away from body → Engage lats, keep bar close

**Progressions:**
- Beginner: Romanian deadlift (RDL) or trap bar deadlift
- Intermediate: Conventional deadlift
- Advanced: Deficit deadlifts, paused deadlifts

<a name="bench-press"></a>
### 3. Bench Press

**Muscles Worked:** Chest, shoulders (front delts), triceps

**Setup:**
1. Lie on bench, eyes under the bar
2. Feet flat on floor, drive through heels (creates leg drive)
3. Arch your upper back slightly, squeeze shoulder blades together
4. Grip slightly wider than shoulders (forearms vertical at bottom)
5. Unrack, hold bar over chest

**Execution:**
1. Take a breath, brace
2. Lower bar to sternum/lower chest (controlled, 2-3 seconds)
3. Bar touches chest briefly (no bounce)
4. Press up and slightly back toward your face (bar path isn't perfectly vertical)
5. Lock out, exhale, repeat

**Key Cues:**
- "Bend the bar" (engages lats, keeps elbows tucked)
- "Leg drive" (push through feet, don't let hips leave the bench)
- "Pull the bar down to your chest" (active eccentric)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Flaring elbows out 90 degrees → Tuck elbows 45 degrees
- ❌ Bouncing off chest → Control the descent, pause briefly
- ❌ Losing shoulder blade retraction → Reset setup every set

**Progressions:**
- Beginner: Dumbbell bench press or push-ups
- Intermediate: Barbell bench press
- Advanced: Pause bench, close-grip bench, board press

### 4. Overhead Press (OHP)

**Muscles Worked:** Shoulders (front/side delts), triceps, upper chest, core

**Setup:**
1. Bar on front delts/collarbone, elbows slightly in front of bar
2. Grip just outside shoulders
3. Feet hip-width apart, squeeze glutes
4. Big breath, brace core

**Execution:**
1. Press bar straight up (move your head back slightly so bar clears your face)
2. Once bar clears your head, push your head through (finish with bar overhead, head neutral)
3. Lock out fully, shrug at the top
4. Lower controlled, bar back to collarbone
5. Exhale, reset, repeat

**Key Cues:**
- "Squeeze glutes" (prevents overarching lower back)
- "Press your head through" (activates upper back)
- "Shrug at lockout" (full ROM, builds traps)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Leaning back too much → Tighten glutes, brace harder
- ❌ Not locking out → Full extension overhead
- ❌ Bar drifts forward → Press straight up, tuck chin

**Progressions:**
- Beginner: Dumbbell shoulder press (seated or standing)
- Intermediate: Barbell overhead press
- Advanced: Push press, strict press from pins

### 5. Barbell Row

**Muscles Worked:** Lats, rhomboids, rear delts, biceps, lower back

**Setup:**
1. Deadlift the bar to standing
2. Hinge at hips, slight knee bend, torso 45 degrees (or parallel to floor for Pendlay rows)
3. Grip slightly wider than shoulders
4. Bar hangs at arm's length, lats engaged
5. Brace core

**Execution:**
1. Pull bar to sternum/lower chest (think "elbows back, not up")
2. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the top
3. Lower controlled, don't let momentum swing the weight
4. Maintain torso angle (don't stand up between reps)

**Key Cues:**
- "Pull elbows to your back pockets"
- "Squeeze shoulder blades at the top"
- "Keep torso stable" (no bouncing)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Standing up between reps → Lock torso angle, brace harder
- ❌ Pulling with biceps only → Lead with elbows, feel your back
- ❌ Jerking the weight → Control the eccentric, no momentum

**Progressions:**
- Beginner: Dumbbell rows, inverted rows
- Intermediate: Barbell rows (Pendlay or bent-over)
- Advanced: Weighted pull-ups, chest-supported rows

## Key Accessory Movements

These fill gaps, build weak points, and add training variety.

---

<a name="rdl"></a>
### Romanian Deadlift (RDL)

**Why:** Hammers hamstrings and glutes without taxing your lower back as much as conventional deadlifts.

**Setup:** Start standing with bar at hip height (like the top of a deadlift).

**Execution:**
1. Slight knee bend, push hips back (hinge, don't squat)
2. Lower bar down shins, keep back flat
3. Stop when you feel a stretch in hamstrings (bar around mid-shin)
4. Drive hips forward to stand back up

**Key Cue:** "Push your butt to the wall behind you."

---

<a name="dumbbell-row"></a>
### Dumbbell Row

**Why:** Builds back strength unilaterally, reduces compensation.

**Setup:** One knee and hand on bench, dumbbell in free hand.

**Execution:**
1. Pull dumbbell to hip, elbow stays close to body
2. Squeeze at the top, lower controlled

**Key Cue:** "Row the dumbbell, don't curl it."

---

<a name="pullup"></a>
### Pull-Up / Lat Pulldown

**Why:** Best vertical pull for lats and biceps.

**Setup:** Hang from bar, hands slightly wider than shoulders, full dead hang.

**Execution:**
1. Pull chest to bar (or as high as you can)
2. Lower controlled, full extension at bottom

**Scaling:** Assisted pull-ups, band-assisted, lat pulldown machine.

---

<a name="dip"></a>
### Dip / Close-Grip Bench

**Why:** Targets triceps and chest, complements regular bench press.

**Setup (Dip):** Hands on parallel bars, start at full arm extension.

**Execution:**
1. Lower until upper arms are parallel to floor
2. Press back up to full lockout

**Scaling:** Bench dips, machine-assisted dips, close-grip bench press.

---

<a name="bulgarian"></a>
### Bulgarian Split Squat

**Why:** Unilateral leg work, fixes imbalances, builds glutes.

**Setup:** Rear foot elevated on bench, front foot 2-3 feet forward.

**Execution:**
1. Lower until front thigh is parallel
2. Drive through front heel to stand

**Key Cue:** "Keep torso upright, don't lean forward."

---

<a name="mistakes"></a>
## Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them

**1. Ego lifting (loading too heavy too soon)**  
→ Leave 1-2 reps in the tank, prioritize form

**2. Half-repping everything**  
→ Film yourself, check depth/ROM

**3. Ignoring bracing**  
→ Practice belly breathing, brace before every rep

**4. Not controlling the eccentric**  
→ 2-3 second descent on all lifts

**5. Knees caving in**  
→ Strengthen glutes, use a mini band around knees

---

<a name="progression"></a>
## Progression Guidelines

**Beginner (0-6 months):**
- Add 5 lbs per session (upper body) or 10 lbs (lower body)
- Focus on technique > weight
- 3 sets of 5 reps for main lifts

**Intermediate (6-18 months):**
- Weekly progression (add weight once per week)
- Introduce variations (pause squats, deficit deadlifts)
- 3-5 sets of 3-5 reps

**Advanced (18+ months):**
- Monthly or block periodization
- Multiple variations and accessories
- Volume and intensity waves

---

## Final Thoughts

**Mastering form takes time.** Don't rush it.

Film your lifts. Compare to these guidelines. Pick one cue per session to drill. Get feedback from a coach.

Good form = sustainable progress. Sloppy form = injuries and plateaus.
