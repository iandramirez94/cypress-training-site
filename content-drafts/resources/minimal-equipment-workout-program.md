**By Ian Ramirez, Cypress Training Center**  
**For:** Anyone with resistance bands and a pair of dumbbells

## Who Is This For?

This program is perfect if you:
- Have limited equipment (bands + a few dumbbells)
- Want a structured 3-day program
- Are working with space or budget constraints
- Travel frequently and want a portable setup

Resistance bands are underrated. Combined with dumbbells, you can hit every muscle group and build real strength.

## The Program

**Schedule:** 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)

### Day A: Push + Legs

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| Band Chest Press | 3 x 12-15 | 90 sec | Anchor band behind you |

**Notes:**
- Band chest press mimics bench press (anchor band to door or pole)
- Goblet squat is your main leg exercise

### Day B: Pull + Core

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|

| Dumbbell Bicep Curl | 3 x 12-15 | 60 sec | Arms |
| Plank | 3 x 30-60 sec | 60 sec | Core |

**Notes:**
- Band rows are your main back exercise
- Dumbbell pullover hits lats
- Face pulls for rear delts and posture
- Curls because you earned them
- Planks for core stability

### Day C: Full Body

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| Dumbbell Thruster | 3 x 10-12 | 90 sec | Squat to press |
| Band Pull-Aparts | 3 x 20-25 | 60 sec | Upper back |
| Dumbbell Swing | 3 x 15-20 | 90 sec | Explosive hinge |
| Band Lateral Raises | 3 x 15-20 | 60 sec | Shoulders |
| Russian Twists | 3 x 20-30 | 60 sec | Hold dumbbell |

**Notes:**
- Thrusters = full-body power
- Pull-aparts for upper back and posture
- Swings for explosive hip power
- Lateral raises for shoulder width
- Russian twists for core rotation

## Progression Rules

**For band exercises:** Add reps when exercises feel easier (aim for top of rep range). When 15+ reps feels easy, upgrade to a heavier band.

**For dumbbell exercises:** Add 2.5-5 lbs when you hit the top of the rep range.

**Example (Goblet Squat):**
- Week 1: 30 lbs × 8 reps
- Week 2: 30 lbs × 10 reps
- Week 3: 30 lbs × 12 reps (hit top of range)
- Week 4: 35 lbs × 8 reps (increase weight)

## Exercise Notes

### Band Chest Press
**How to do it:**
1. Anchor band behind you (door anchor or pole)
2. Hold handles at chest level
3. Press forward until arms are straight
4. Control back to start

**Tips:** Stand in a staggered stance for better balance. Keep core braced.

### Band Rows
**How to do it:**
1. Anchor band in front of you
2. Hold handles, arms extended
3. Pull handles to your torso (like a rowing motion)
4. Squeeze shoulder blades together
5. Control back to start

**Tips:** Keep your back flat. Don't lean back — this is a pulling motion, not a full-body yank.

### Dumbbell Thruster
**How to do it:**
1. Hold dumbbells at shoulders
2. Squat down
3. As you stand up, press dumbbells overhead
4. Lower dumbbells back to shoulders

**Why:** Full-body power exercise. Builds legs, shoulders, and conditioning.

### Band Face Pulls
**How to do it:**
1. Anchor band at face height
2. Hold handles, arms extended
3. Pull handles toward your face (hands separate as you pull)
4. Squeeze rear delts at the end
5. Control back to start

**Why:** Rear delts, upper back, posture. Everyone should do these.

### Dumbbell Swing
**How to do it:**
1. Hold one dumbbell with both hands
2. Hinge at hips (like an RDL)
3. Swing dumbbell between legs
4. Explode hips forward, swing dumbbell to chest height
5. Let momentum carry it, don't curl it

**Why:** Explosive hip power. Great for conditioning and glute strength.

## FAQs

### What resistance should I get for bands?

Buy a set with multiple resistances (light, medium, heavy). You'll use different bands for different exercises.

**Recommended:** Rogue Fitness, EliteFTS, or Serious Steel bands. Avoid cheap Amazon bands that snap.

### Can I build muscle with bands?

Yes, but bands are better for higher-rep work (12-20 reps). Dumbbells are better for heavy, low-rep strength work. This program combines both for the best of both worlds.

### What if I don't have a door anchor for bands?

- Anchor around a sturdy pole, tree, or fence post
- Step on the band for vertical exercises (overhead press, bicep curls)
- Loop around a table leg for rows

### How long until I see results?

- **Strength:** 4-6 weeks
- **Muscle:** 6-8 weeks (if you're eating enough)
- **Fat loss:** 4-6 weeks (if you're eating in a deficit)

### What weight dumbbells should I buy?

**Minimum:** One pair of 20-30 lb dumbbells  
**Better:** Two pairs (15-20 lbs for upper body, 30-40 lbs for lower body)  
**Best:** Adjustable dumbbells (PowerBlock or Bowflex) that go up to 50+ lbs

## Final Thoughts

You don't need a full home gym. Bands and dumbbells are enough to build real strength.

This program gives you a balance of resistance (bands for volume, dumbbells for heavy strength work) and hits every muscle group 1-2x per week.

Train 3 days per week. Progress when you can. Eat enough protein. Sleep well.

Do that for 12 weeks and you'll be stronger and more muscular than most people with full gym access.
