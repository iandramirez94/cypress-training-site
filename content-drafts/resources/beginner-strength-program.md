# Beginner Strength Program (4 Weeks)

**By Ian Ramirez, Cypress Training Center**  
**Program Level:** Beginner (0-6 months training experience)  
**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Frequency:** 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday recommended)  
**Goal:** Build strength foundation with the Big 5 compound movements

**Program Note:** This program is heavily based on **Starting Strength** by Mark Rippetoe, one of the most effective beginner programs ever written. The core structure (3x5 linear progression, alternating A/B days, emphasis on the Big 5) comes directly from that system. I've adapted it slightly for a 4-week introduction, but credit goes to Rippetoe for the original framework.

## Program Overview

This is a **linear progression program** built around the Big 5 compound movements:
- Squat
- Deadlift
- Bench Press
- Overhead Press
- Barbell Row

**Why these movements?**  
They train the most muscle mass in the shortest time. Master these five and you'll have a strength foundation that transfers to everything else.

**What makes this different from other beginner programs?**  
- Simple progression (add weight every session)
- Just 3 days per week (recovery built in)
- No fluff (no curls, ab work, or fancy accessories until you earn them)

**Credit Where Credit Is Due:**  
This program structure comes from Mark Rippetoe's **Starting Strength**, widely considered the gold standard for beginner barbell training. If you want the full version with detailed form instruction and programming beyond 4 weeks, get the book.

## Who Is This For?

**This program is for you if:**
- You're new to strength training (0-6 months experience)
- You have access to a barbell and power rack
- You can train 3 days per week consistently
- You want to get stronger, build muscle, and learn proper form

**This program is NOT for you if:**
- You've been lifting consistently for 12+ months (you need more advanced programming)
- You can't train 3x per week (try a 2-day full-body split instead)
- You have injuries that prevent squatting, deadlifting, or pressing (email me for modifications)

<a name="equipment"></a>
## Equipment Needed

**Minimum:**
- Barbell (45 lbs)
- Power rack or squat stands
- Bench (flat or adjustable)
- Plates (25s, 10s, 5s, 2.5s)

**Optional (but helpful):**
- Microplates (1.25 lb or fractional plates for upper body lifts)
- Lifting belt (once you're squatting/deadlifting 1.5x bodyweight)

**Can I do this at home?**  
Yes, if you have the equipment above. If you only have dumbbells, email me for a dumbbell-only version.

## Week 1-4 Workouts

### Day A: Squat, Bench, Row

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Back Squat | 3 x 5 | 3 min |
| Bench Press | 3 x 5 | 3 min |
| Barbell Row | 3 x 5 | 2 min |

---

### Day B: Squat, Overhead Press, Deadlift

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Back Squat | 3 x 5 | 3 min |
| Overhead Press | 3 x 5 | 3 min |
| Deadlift | 1 x 5 | 3 min |

**Why only 1 set of deadlifts?**  
Deadlifts are brutal. One heavy set is enough for beginners. You're also squatting 3x per week, which hits similar muscles.

## Progression Rules

**Week 1: Find Your Starting Weights**

Your first week is about finding weights you can lift with clean form for 3 sets of 5 reps, leaving 1-2 reps in the tank.

**Example starting weights (adjust based on your strength):**
- Squat: 95-135 lbs
- Bench: 65-95 lbs
- Overhead Press: 45-65 lbs
- Row: 65-95 lbs
- Deadlift: 135-185 lbs

**If you're not sure, start light.** You'll add weight fast.

---

**Weeks 2-4: Linear Progression**

Add weight every session:
- **Lower body (squat, deadlift):** +10 lbs per session
- **Upper body (bench, press, row):** +5 lbs per session

**Example progression (Squat):**
- Session 1: 135 lbs x 3x5
- Session 2: 145 lbs x 3x5
- Session 3: 155 lbs x 3x5
- Session 4: 165 lbs x 3x5
- Session 5: 175 lbs x 3x5
- Session 6: 185 lbs x 3x5

By the end of 4 weeks, you'll have added 50+ lbs to your squat.

---

**What if I fail a set?**

If you can't complete all 3 sets of 5 reps:
1. **First time:** Repeat the same weight next session
2. **Second time in a row:** Drop 10% and rebuild

**Example:**  
- Session 5: 185 lbs squat — only got 5, 5, 4 reps (failed last set)
- Session 6: Repeat 185 lbs — got 5, 5, 5 (success)
- Session 7: Add 10 lbs → 195 lbs

Don't rush the progression. Slow and steady wins.

## Warm-Up Protocol

**General Warm-Up (5 minutes):**
- Light cardio (bike, row, jog) to break a sweat
- Dynamic stretches (leg swings, arm circles, cat-cow)

**Lift-Specific Warm-Up:**

**For Squat/Deadlift:**
- Bar x 10 reps
- 95 lbs x 5 reps
- 135 lbs x 3 reps
- Add weight until you hit your working weight

**For Bench/Press/Row:**
- Bar x 10 reps
- 65 lbs x 5 reps
- Add weight until you hit your working weight

**Rule of thumb:** Do 2-4 warm-up sets, increasing weight each time. Never go to failure on warm-ups.

## FAQs

### 1. Can I add more exercises?

Not yet. Master the Big 5 first. After 8-12 weeks, we can add accessories (curls, tricep work, ab training).

### 2. What about cardio?

2-3 sessions per week, 20-30 minutes, easy pace (Zone 2). Don't run a 10K the day before squats.

### 3. How much should I eat?

**To build muscle:** Eat in a slight surplus (200-300 calories above maintenance)  
**To lose fat:** Eat in a slight deficit (200-300 calories below maintenance)  
**To maintain:** Eat at maintenance

Prioritize protein: 0.8-1g per lb of bodyweight.

### 4. Do I need supplements?

No. Eat enough protein, sleep 7-9 hours, stay hydrated. Supplements are 5% of the equation.

If you want to supplement:
- **Creatine** (5g/day) — proven to help strength and recovery
- **Protein powder** — convenient way to hit protein targets
- **Caffeine** — pre-workout if you need energy

### 5. What if I miss a workout?

Life happens. Just pick up where you left off. Don't try to "make up" missed workouts by doubling up.

### 6. Can I train 4 or 5 days per week?

You can, but you don't need to. More isn't always better. Stick with 3 days for the first 12 weeks. Add volume when progress stalls.

### 7. My lower back is sore after squats/deadlifts. Is that normal?

Some soreness is normal. Sharp pain or pain that doesn't go away is not. Check your form. Film yourself. Email me if you're unsure.

### 8. When should I deload?

Every 6-8 weeks, take a lighter week (use 50-60% of your working weights). Deloads help your body catch up.

## After Week 4: What's Next?

**If you completed all 4 weeks and made progress:**  
Continue with the same program for another 4-8 weeks. Linear progression works until it doesn't.

**If you're stalling:**  
- Check your sleep (are you getting 7-9 hours?)
- Check your nutrition (are you eating enough?)
- Check your form (film your lifts, compare to the Form Guide)

**If you're crushing it and want more volume:**  
Email me at ian@cypresstrainingcenter.com. I'll send you the next program (Intermediate 4-Day Split).

## Final Thoughts

This program is simple. It's not fancy. It doesn't have drop sets, supersets, or Instagram-friendly circuits.

**But it works.**

Show up 3x per week. Add weight when you can. Eat and sleep enough.

Do that for 12 weeks and you'll be stronger than 90% of people in your gym.
