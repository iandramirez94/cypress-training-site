## The Truth About Macros

You don't need to count macros to get results.

**But understanding them helps.**

Macros = macronutrients = protein, carbs, and fat. The three building blocks of everything you eat.

Most people overcomplicate this. They track every gram, stress about timing, and wonder why they're not seeing results.

Here's the reality: **total calories matter most.** Macros are second. Timing is a distant third.

Let's break it down.

## The 3 Macros (And What They Do)

### 1. Protein

**What it does:**
- Builds and repairs muscle
- Keeps you full
- Prevents muscle loss when losing fat

**How much you need:**
- **Building muscle:** 0.8-1g per lb of bodyweight
- **Losing fat:** 1-1.2g per lb of bodyweight (higher protein preserves muscle)
- **Maintaining:** 0.7-0.8g per lb of bodyweight

**Example:** 180 lb person → 144-180g protein per day

**Best sources:**
- Chicken, beef, pork, fish
- Eggs
- Greek yogurt, cottage cheese
- Protein powder (whey, casein, plant-based)

**Priority:** Protein comes first. Hit your protein target every day. Everything else is negotiable.

---

### 2. Carbs

**What they do:**
- Fuel training (especially high-intensity work)
- Replenish glycogen (stored energy in muscles)
- Support hormones (low carb for too long = low testosterone, poor recovery)

**How much you need:**
- **Active lifters:** 150-300g per day (depends on training volume)
- **Less active:** 100-150g per day
- **Very active (athletes, high-volume training):** 300-400g+ per day

**Best sources:**
- Rice, oats, quinoa, pasta
- Potatoes, sweet potatoes
- Bread, tortillas
- Fruit

**The carb debate:**  
Low-carb works for fat loss. High-carb works for performance. Pick based on your goal and how you feel.

---

### 3. Fat

**What it does:**
- Supports hormone production (testosterone, estrogen)
- Helps absorb vitamins (A, D, E, K)
- Keeps you full

**How much you need:**
- **Minimum:** 0.3-0.4g per lb of bodyweight (for hormones)
- **Typical range:** 50-100g per day

**Best sources:**
- Olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil
- Nuts, nut butters
- Avocado
- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel)
- Eggs, butter

**Common mistake:**  
Going too low on fat. If you're under 40g/day for weeks, your hormones will suffer. Don't cut fat to chase abs.

## Step-by-Step: How to Set Your Macros

### Step 1: Calculate Your Maintenance Calories

**Maintenance = the calories you need to maintain your current weight.**

**Quick formula:**
- **Bodyweight (lbs) × 14-16** = maintenance calories

**Example:** 180 lbs × 15 = 2,700 calories/day

(Multiply by 14 if you're sedentary, 15 if moderately active, 16 if very active)

**More accurate method:**  
Track your food for 2 weeks. Weigh yourself daily. If your weight stays the same, that's your maintenance.

---

### Step 2: Adjust Based on Your Goal

**Goal: Build Muscle (Lean Bulk)**
- Eat **200-300 calories above maintenance**
- Example: 2,700 + 250 = 2,950 calories/day
- Gain 0.5-1 lb per week (slower = less fat gain)

**Goal: Lose Fat (Cut)**
- Eat **200-500 calories below maintenance**
- Example: 2,700 - 300 = 2,400 calories/day
- Lose 0.5-1.5 lbs per week

**Goal: Maintain (Recomp)**
- Eat **at maintenance**
- Example: 2,700 calories/day
- Slowly build muscle and lose fat (works best for beginners)

---

### Step 3: Set Your Protein Target

**Use 1g per lb of bodyweight** (or 0.8-1g if you prefer)

**Example:** 180 lbs × 1g = 180g protein/day

**In calories:** 180g × 4 cal/g = 720 calories from protein

---

### Step 4: Set Your Fat Target

**Use 0.3-0.4g per lb of bodyweight**

**Example:** 180 lbs × 0.4g = 72g fat/day

**In calories:** 72g × 9 cal/g = 648 calories from fat

---

### Step 5: Fill the Rest with Carbs

**Remaining calories = carbs**

**Example (2,950 calorie bulk):**
- Total calories: 2,950
- Protein: 720 calories
- Fat: 648 calories
- **Remaining:** 2,950 - 720 - 648 = **1,582 calories from carbs**

**Convert to grams:** 1,582 ÷ 4 = **395g carbs/day**

---

## Your Macro Targets (Example: 180 lb Lifter)

| Goal | Calories | Protein | Carbs | Fat |
|------|----------|---------|-------|-----|
| **Bulk** | 2,950 | 180g | 395g | 72g |
| **Maintain** | 2,700 | 180g | 333g | 72g |
| **Cut** | 2,400 | 180g | 258g | 72g |

Adjust based on your bodyweight and activity level.

## Meal Timing: Does It Matter?

**Short answer:** Not as much as you think.

**What matters most:**
1. Hit your total daily protein
2. Hit your total daily calories

**What matters a little:**
- Eating protein post-workout (helps recovery, but the "anabolic window" is overblown)
- Spreading protein across 3-4 meals (better for muscle protein synthesis than 1-2 huge meals)

**What doesn't matter:**
- Eating carbs before bed (won't make you fat)
- Eating every 2-3 hours (meal frequency doesn't boost metabolism)
- Fasted cardio (burns the same calories as fed cardio)

**Bottom line:** Eat when it fits your schedule. Focus on daily totals.

## Meal Prep 101: Simple Strategies

**1. Build a Template**

Every meal = Protein + Carb + Fat + Veggies

**Examples:**
- Chicken breast + rice + avocado + broccoli
- Ground beef + sweet potato + olive oil + spinach
- Salmon + quinoa + butter + asparagus
- Eggs + oats + peanut butter + berries

**2. Batch Cook**

Cook 3-5 days of meals at once:
- Sunday: Cook chicken, rice, veggies
- Store in containers
- Reheat as needed

**3. Keep It Simple**

You don't need 20 recipes. Find 5-7 meals you like and rotate them.

**Boring? Yes. Effective? Absolutely.**

---

## What About Supplements?

**Do you need them? No.**  
**Do they help? Some.**

**Worth it:**
- **Protein powder** — convenient way to hit protein targets
- **Creatine** — 5g/day, proven to help strength and muscle gain
- **Caffeine** — pre-workout if you need energy

**Not worth it (yet):**
- Fat burners (save your money)
- BCAAs (if you're eating enough protein, you don't need these)
- Pre-workouts with 30 ingredients (most are underdosed)

**Focus on food first. Supplements are 5% of the equation.**

## Common Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

### 1. Not tracking anything

"I eat clean" doesn't mean you're eating enough (or little enough).

**Fix:** Track for 2 weeks. You'll learn portion sizes and adjust.

### 2. Cutting carbs too low too fast

Your training will suffer. Your hormones will crash. You'll feel like crap.

**Fix:** Drop calories gradually (200-300 at a time), keep carbs moderate.

### 3. Ignoring protein

You can't build muscle on 80g of protein per day.

**Fix:** Hit 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight. Every. Single. Day.

### 4. Obsessing over "clean" foods

There's no magic in chicken and broccoli. You can eat pizza and ice cream and still make progress.

**Fix:** 80% whole foods, 20% whatever you want. Hit your macros.

### 5. Forgetting about vegetables

Micronutrients matter. Fiber matters. Gut health matters.

**Fix:** Eat 2-3 servings of veggies per day. Spinach, broccoli, peppers, whatever.

**Eat enough protein. Hit your calories. Train hard. Sleep well.**

Do that consistently for 12 weeks and you'll see more progress than 95% of people who overthink macros and never actually execute.
