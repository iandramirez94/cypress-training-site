## The Program

**Schedule:** 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)

### Day A: Push Focus

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|

| Plank | 3 x 30-60 sec | 60 sec | Brace core hard |

**Scaling:**

| Hollow Body Hold | 3 x 20-40 sec | 60 sec | Core stability |

**Scaling:**

## Progression Rules

**Week 1-2: Find Your Baseline**
- Learn the movements
- Find how many reps you can do with good form
- Don't push to absolute failure yet

**Week 3-4: Add Reps**
- Add 1-2 reps per set each week
- Example: Week 3: 10 push-ups → Week 4: 12 push-ups

**Week 5-6: Add Tempo**
- 3-second descent on all exercises
- 1-second pause at bottom
- Example: Push-up becomes 3-second down, 1-second pause, explosive up

**Week 7-8: Add Difficulty**
- Elevate feet on push-ups
- Add pause at bottom of squats
- Slower tempo on rows
- Use a weighted vest or backpack if available

**When to progress:**
- If you can do 15+ reps on push-ups → elevate feet or add tempo
- If you can do 10+ pull-ups → add weight (backpack with books)
- If you can do 20+ split squats → add single-arm overhead hold

## Exercise Notes

### Push-Ups
**How to do it:**
1. Hands slightly wider than shoulders
2. Body in straight line (no sagging hips)
3. Lower until chest touches floor
4. Press back up

**Common mistakes:**
- Sagging hips (brace your core)
- Not going full depth (chest to floor every rep)
- Flaring elbows out 90 degrees (tuck to 45 degrees)

### Pike Push-Ups
**How to do it:**
1. Start in downward dog position (hips high, feet and hands on floor)
2. Lower your head toward the floor (bend elbows)
3. Press back up

**Why:** Targets shoulders more than regular push-ups

### Pull-Ups / Inverted Rows
**How to do it (pull-ups):**
1. Hang from bar, full dead hang
2. Pull chest to bar
3. Lower with control to full extension

**How to do it (inverted rows):**
1. Lie under a sturdy table
2. Grab edge of table, body straight
3. Pull chest to table

**No pull-up bar?** Use inverted rows. Same muscle groups, no bar needed.

### Bulgarian Split Squat
**How to do it:**
1. Rear foot elevated on bench or chair
2. Front foot 2-3 feet forward
3. Lower until front thigh is parallel
4. Drive through front heel to stand

**Why:** Builds single-leg strength, fixes imbalances

### Single-Leg RDL
**How to do it:**
1. Stand on one leg
2. Hinge at hips, reach down with opposite hand
3. Feel stretch in hamstring
4. Drive hip forward to stand

**Why:** Hamstrings, balance, and glute strength

## FAQs

### Can I build muscle with bodyweight training?

Yes, especially if you're a beginner. Once you can do 20+ push-ups and 10+ pull-ups, you'll need to add difficulty (tempo, pause, single-arm variations, weighted vest).

### What if I don't have a pull-up bar?

Use inverted rows under a sturdy table. Fill a backpack with books and do bent-over rows. Or buy a doorway pull-up bar for $20-30 (best investment for home training).

### How do I add weight to bodyweight exercises?

- Wear a weighted vest or backpack filled with books
- Add tempo (3-second descent, 2-second pause)
- Increase difficulty (elevate feet, single-arm push-ups, archer pull-ups)

### Can I do this 5-6 days per week?

You can, but you don't need to. Stick with 3-4 days for the first 8-12 weeks. More isn't always better.

### How long until I see results?

- **Strength:** 4-6 weeks (you'll feel stronger, reps will increase)
- **Muscle:** 6-8 weeks (visible changes if you're eating enough)
- **Fat loss:** 4-6 weeks (if you're eating in a deficit)

## Final Thoughts

Bodyweight training works. You don't need a gym. You need a plan and the discipline to follow it.

Train 3 days per week. Add reps when you can. Add difficulty when you hit 15+ reps. Eat enough protein. Sleep well.

Do that for 12 weeks and you'll build more strength than most people who spin their wheels in a fully-equipped gym.
