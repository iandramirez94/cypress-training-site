# 5 Form Mistakes Killing Your Gains

You're showing up to the gym. You're following a program. You're adding weight when you can.

But your lifts aren't moving. Your shoulders hurt. Your lower back aches after squats.

**The problem isn't your program. It's your form.**

Bad form doesn't just slow progress — it actively sabotages it. You're loading dysfunctional patterns, building strength on top of compensation, and digging yourself into a hole that takes months to climb out of.

Here are the 5 most common form mistakes I see (and how to fix them).

---

## 1. Half-Repping Everything

**The mistake:**  
Squatting to parallel (or above). Benching without touching your chest. Rows that stop 6 inches from your torso.

**Why it kills gains:**  
Partial range of motion = partial strength. You're only training the easiest part of the lift. When you finally need full ROM strength (sports, life, actually hitting depth), you don't have it.

**The fix:**  
- **Squat:** Hip crease below knee. If you're not sure, film it from the side.
- **Bench:** Bar touches chest every rep (unless you have shoulder issues — then we modify).
- **Row:** Bar or dumbbells touch your torso. No floating reps.

Drop the weight if you have to. Full ROM with 135 > half reps with 225.

## 2. Ego Lifting (Loading Too Heavy, Too Soon)

**The mistake:**  
Adding weight every session even when form breaks down. Grinding through ugly reps because "the program says 5x5."

**Why it kills gains:**  
Your nervous system learns whatever pattern you repeat. If you're grinding ugly reps, you're teaching your body to move like crap. Injuries pile up. Progress stalls because you can't recover.

**The fix:**  
- **Leave 1-2 reps in the tank.** If the bar speed slows to a crawl, you're too heavy.
- **Film your top sets.** If form breaks down, repeat the weight next session.
- **Progress when you're ready, not because the calendar says so.**

A slow, controlled 185 squat > a shaky 225 where your knees cave and your back rounds.

## 3. Ignoring Bracing (Especially on Squats and Deadlifts)

**The mistake:**  
Taking a shallow breath (or no breath at all) before a heavy rep. Letting your ribs flare. Losing tension mid-set.

**Why it kills gains:**  
Your core is the foundation for every big lift. No brace = no stability = weaker lifts + back pain.

**The fix:**  
**Before every heavy rep:**
1. Take a deep breath into your belly (not your chest)
2. Brace like you're about to get punched in the gut
3. Hold that tension through the entire rep
4. Exhale at the top, reset, repeat

**Test:** Put your hands on your obliques. Breathe in — you should feel your sides expand 360 degrees. If your chest rises but your belly doesn't, you're breathing wrong.

Practice this with an empty bar. Nail it light, then load it heavy.

## 4. Not Controlling the Eccentric (Lowering Phase)

**The mistake:**  
Dropping the bar on bench. Free-falling into the bottom of a squat. Letting deadlifts crash to the floor.

**Why it kills gains:**  
The eccentric (lowering) phase builds strength and muscle. Skipping it = leaving gains on the table.

It also teaches your nervous system to decelerate the load. If you can't control the descent, you're at higher risk of injury when things get heavy.

**The fix:**  
- **Squat:** 2-3 second descent. Controlled, not rushed.
- **Bench:** Lower the bar under control. Touch your chest, don't bounce.
- **Deadlift:** Lower the bar with control (unless you're maxing out — then a controlled drop is fine).

The eccentric is where muscle damage happens. Control it.

## 5. Letting Your Knees Cave In (Valgus Collapse)

**The mistake:**  
Knees dive inward during squats, lunges, or deadlifts.

**Why it kills gains:**  
Valgus collapse shifts stress from your quads and glutes to your knees and IT band. Over time, this leads to knee pain, patellar tendinitis, and weak glutes that can't fire properly.

It's a compensation pattern. Your body is taking the path of least resistance because your glutes, adductors, or VMO (inner quad) are weak.

**The fix:**  
- **Cue:** "Spread the floor" as you squat. Push your knees out as you descend.
- **Drill:** Pause squats with a mini band around your knees. Fight the band outward the entire time.
- **Strengthening:** Add glute bridges, clamshells, and Bulgarian split squats to rebuild the weak links.

Film yourself from the front. If your knees track inward past your toes, you're collapsing. Drop the weight and retrain the pattern.

## How to Actually Fix Your Form

Knowing the mistakes isn't enough. You need a system to correct them.

**Step 1: Film yourself**  
Side and front angles. Compare to a good reference (YouTube channels like Alan Thrall, Starting Strength, or Elite FTS).

**Step 2: Pick ONE cue at a time**  
Don't try to fix everything at once. This week, focus on bracing. Next week, knee tracking. Break it into chunks.

**Step 3: Drop the weight and drill the pattern**  
Spend 2-3 sessions at 60-70% of your working weight. Nail the movement. Then reload.

**Step 4: Get feedback**  
Hire a coach. Post a form check in a strength training forum. Ask someone who knows what they're doing to watch your lifts.

## The Bottom Line

You can't out-program bad form.

If your technique sucks, no amount of volume, periodization, or "effort" will save you. You'll spin your wheels, get hurt, and wonder why everyone else is making progress.

**Fix your form. Progress will follow.**
