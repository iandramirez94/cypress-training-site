Starting a strength training program can feel overwhelming. Should you join a gym? What exercises should you do? How much weight? How many sets? How often?

Here's the truth: most people overcomplicate it.

You don't need a perfect plan. You don't need expensive equipment. You don't need to understand periodization, deloads, or RPE scales on day one.

**You need three things:**
1. A few basic movements
2. A way to track progress
3. Consistency

Let's break it down.

## Step 1: Pick Your Big 5

Every good strength program is built around compound movements — exercises that use multiple joints and muscle groups. These give you the most bang for your buck.

**The Big 5:**
- **Squat** (legs + core)
- **Deadlift** (full posterior chain)
- **Bench Press or Push-Up** (chest, shoulders, triceps)
- **Overhead Press** (shoulders, triceps, upper chest)
- **Row** (back, biceps, rear delts)

If you have access to a barbell, these are your bread and butter. If you're training at home with dumbbells, that works too. Don't have weights at all? Bodyweight variations of these movements will get you started.

**Start here.** Don't add curls, ab work, or fancy accessories until you can consistently do these five movements with good form.

## Step 2: Learn the Movement, Then Add Weight

The biggest mistake beginners make? Loading up the bar before they own the movement pattern.

Your first few workouts should feel easy. You're teaching your nervous system a new skill. If you're shaking, grinding, or losing form, you're going too heavy.

**How to learn:**
- **Week 1-2:** Use just the bar (45 lbs) or light dumbbells. Focus on feeling the right muscles work. Film yourself from the side.
- **Week 3-4:** Add 5-10 lbs per session if form stays clean. Stop the set when form breaks down, not when you hit failure.

Good form = long-term progress. Sloppy form = injuries and plateaus.

---

## Step 3: Follow a Simple Progression

Once you can squat, deadlift, press, and row with decent form, you need a plan for adding weight over time.

**The simplest progression (linear progression):**
- Do 3 sets of 5 reps for your main lifts
- Add 5 lbs to upper body lifts every workout
- Add 10 lbs to lower body lifts every workout
- When you fail to complete all sets, repeat the same weight next session
- If you fail twice in a row, drop 10% and rebuild

This works for 3-6 months for most beginners. You'll add 50+ lbs to your squat, 30+ lbs to your bench, and build a solid base of strength.

## Step 4: Train 3 Days Per Week

**Sample beginner schedule:**

**Day A (Monday):**
- Squat 3x5
- Bench Press 3x5
- Barbell Row 3x5

**Day B (Wednesday):**
- Squat 3x5
- Overhead Press 3x5
- Deadlift 1x5

**Day C (Friday):**
- Squat 3x5
- Bench Press 3x5
- Barbell Row 3x5

Alternate A/B each week. That's it.

**Why 3 days?**
- Enough frequency to build the skill and trigger adaptation
- Enough rest to recover and get stronger
- Sustainable long-term (you won't burn out in 6 weeks)

---

## Step 5: Track Everything

Write down every workout. Every set, every rep, every weight.

**Why?**
- You can't improve what you don't measure
- Progress isn't linear — some days feel heavy, some feel light. The notebook shows the trend.
- When you plateau, you can look back and see what worked

Use a notebook, a spreadsheet, an app — doesn't matter. Just track.

## Common Beginner Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. **Jumping programs every month**
Stick with one program for at least 12 weeks. You need time to adapt and see results.

### 2. **Adding too much volume too soon**
More isn't better. Three hard sets is enough when you're a beginner. Save the 10-set chest days for later.

### 3. **Ignoring recovery**
Sleep 7-9 hours. Eat enough protein (0.8-1g per lb of bodyweight). Take rest days seriously.

### 4. **Chasing soreness**
Soreness ≠ progress. Strength gains = progress. Don't program extra volume just to feel wrecked.

### 5. **Skipping deloads**
Every 6-8 weeks, take a lighter week (50-60% of your working weights). Let your body catch up.

## What About Cardio?

Cardio won't kill your gains, but it can interfere if you overdo it.

**My recommendation:**
- 2-3 sessions per week, 20-30 minutes
- Keep it easy (Zone 2, conversational pace)
- Don't run a marathon while trying to add 100 lbs to your squat

Strength comes first. Conditioning fills the gaps.

## When Should You Hire a Coach?

You don't need a coach to start. But a coach makes sense when:
- You've been lifting 6+ months and progress stalls
- You have injuries or limitations that need modification
- You want customized programming for specific goals
- You need accountability (this is the #1 reason most people hire me)

A good coach saves you years of trial-and-error. A bad coach wastes your time and money. Choose carefully.

## Final Thoughts

Strength training isn't rocket science. It's simple, but it's not easy.

**Show up 3x per week. Do the Big 5. Add weight when you can. Track everything. Eat and sleep enough.**

Do that for 6 months and you'll be stronger, leaner, and more confident than 90% of people who start and quit after 3 weeks.
